# Lojban Translation of Pokémon Red and Blue

This is a fan translation of the original Gameboy games Pokemon Red and Blue
into [Lojban](http://lojban.org).

## Translation

**Current state:** Only a few things are translated: Prof. Oak's opening speech and
item names, and some other miscellaneous dialogue.

**Priorities:** Names of Pokemon and attacks.

Pull requests are most welcome, as are "bugs" filed with translations, if you
aren't prepared to edit the assembly itself.

See [Lojban.md](Lojban.md) for notes and things to consider when translating.

The biggest rule of translation is **keep it short**. Space is very limited on
the screen, and to a lesser extent in the Gameboy "cartridge".

## Installation

See [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md) for instructions on setup.

## Attribution

Many thanks to the "pret" project, from which this is forked. Their complete
disassembly of the original games makes this project many times easier.
